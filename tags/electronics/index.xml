      <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="data-transmission">Data Transmission</h1>
<p>Data transmission can be categorized into two main types: <strong>Serial</strong> and <strong>Parallel</strong>. Serial communication, in particular, has several subtypes, including <strong>Asynchronous</strong>, <strong>Synchronous</strong>, and <strong>Isochronous</strong>. In this post, we’ll focus on <strong>UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)</strong>, which is an asynchronous method of communication. Unlike synchronous communication, UART does not require devices to share the same clock cycles or be synchronized.</p>

<h2 id="serial-vs-parallel-transmission">Serial vs. Parallel Transmission</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Serial Transmission</strong>: Data is sent one bit at a time over a single communication channel. This method is simpler and more cost-effective but can be slower compared to parallel transmission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Parallel Transmission</strong>: Data is sent in groups of 8 bits (a byte) simultaneously over multiple channels. While faster, it is more complex and expensive due to the need for multiple communication lines.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both methods enable devices to communicate, but they differ in their approach. Serial transmission is often preferred for its simplicity and lower cost, while parallel transmission is used when speed is critical.</p>

<h3 id="key-terms">Key Terms:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>MSB (Most Significant Bit)</strong>: The bit with the highest value in a byte (e.g., 2^7).</li>
<li><strong>LSB (Least Significant Bit)</strong>: The bit with the lowest value in a byte (e.g., 2^0).</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="serial-transmission">Serial Transmission</h2>
<p>In serial transmission, bits are sent one after another over a single communication channel. This reduces the cost of transmission compared to parallel methods, which require multiple channels. Serial transmission can be implemented in three ways: <strong>asynchronous</strong>, <strong>synchronous</strong>, and <strong>isochronous</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="asynchronous-transmission-uart">Asynchronous Transmission (UART)</h3>
<p>Asynchronous transmission does not rely on a shared clock signal between devices. Instead, it uses agreed-upon patterns to communicate data. Each byte of data is framed with a <strong>start bit</strong> and one or more <strong>stop bits</strong>, allowing the receiver to identify the beginning and end of each byte.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start Bit</strong>: A single bit (usually 0) that signals the start of a byte.</li>
<li><strong>Stop Bit(s)</strong>: One or more bits (usually 1s) that signal the end of a byte.</li>
</ul>
<p>Between bytes, there may be a gap or idle time, which helps the receiver prepare for the next byte. The receiver synchronizes with the incoming data stream at the start of each byte, ensuring accurate data interpretation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Asynchronous transmission is &ldquo;asynchronous at the byte level,&rdquo; but the bits within each byte are still synchronized.</p>

<h2 id="uart-universal-asynchronous-receiver-transmitter">UART: Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter</h2>
<p>UART is a hardware device that facilitates asynchronous serial communication. It uses two wires:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tx (Transmit)</strong>: Sends data from the transmitting device.</li>
<li><strong>Rx (Receive)</strong>: Receives data at the receiving device.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/Pasted%20image%2020250215052600.png" alt="Image Description"></p>
<p>The communication speed, known as the <strong>baud rate</strong>, must be agreed upon by both devices.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="baud-rate-how-it-works">Baud Rate: How It Works</h3>
<p>The <strong>baud rate</strong> is a critical parameter in serial communication, especially in UART. It defines the speed at which data is transmitted and received, measured in <strong>bits per second (bps)</strong>. Here’s how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: The baud rate represents the number of signal changes (symbols) per second. In UART, each symbol typically corresponds to one bit, so the baud rate is often equal to the bit rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Synchronization</strong>: Both the transmitter and receiver must be configured to use the same baud rate. If they are not synchronized, data will be misinterpreted, leading to communication errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Common Baud Rates</strong>: Some standard baud rates include 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, and 115200 bps. Lower baud rates are used for longer distances or noisy environments, while higher baud rates are used for faster communication over shorter distances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Calculation</strong>: The baud rate determines the duration of each bit. For example, at 9600 bps, each bit lasts approximately 104 microseconds (1 second / 9600 bits).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Error Tolerance</strong>: The receiver samples the incoming data at the midpoint of each bit. If the baud rates of the transmitter and receiver are slightly mismatched, the sampling point may drift, causing errors. Therefore, precise baud rate configuration is essential.</p>
</li>

      <title>Understanding Capacitor Charging and the Concept of Full Charge</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>While taking a <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLww54WQ2wa5qVh1p8iPi7HspX7N9hbvbc&amp;si=9h1KH2NZG2lSLsaB">course with Walid Issa</a>, we explored the fascinating behavior of capacitors. During one of the experiments, an interesting observation about capacitor charging sparked my curiosity. My friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmad-awad-36b481301/">Ahmad Awad</a> and I decided to dive deeper into the topic, conducting research that ultimately led to this blog.</p>
<p>When analyzing capacitors, we often hear that a capacitor is &ldquo;fully charged&rdquo; when the elapsed time equals 5 times the time constant (“5τ”). However, upon closer look, this statement needs some clarification. Let&rsquo;s dive into the theory, practical observations, and what &ldquo;fully charged&rdquo; really means.</p>
<h2 id="observations-from-the-simulation">Observations from the Simulation</h2>
<p><img src="/images/Pasted%20image%2020250121022953.png" alt="Image Description">
<img src="/images/Pasted%20image%2020250121023020.png" alt="Image Description"></p>
<p>In a recent calculation, the capacitor was expected to be fully charged in 0.25 seconds. However, the voltage across the capacitor at this point was 11.923 V instead of the expected 12 V. The error was calculated as:</p>
<p>$$ \frac{12 - 11.923}{12} \times 100 = 0.6% $$</p>
<p>This raised the question: Why is there an error when the capacitor is supposed to be fully charged at 5τ?</p>
<h2 id="the-truth-about-5τ">The Truth About 5τ</h2>
<p>The value of 5τ does not mean the capacitor is 100% charged. Instead, it means the capacitor has reached about 99.3% of its maximum voltage. Using the data from the simulation, we can confirm this:</p>
<p>$$ \frac{11.923}{12} \times 100 = 99.33% $$</p>
<p>This matches the theoretical prediction. While the capacitor seems nearly charged at 5τ, it never fully reaches 100% because of the exponential nature of its charging curve.</p>
<h2 id="theoretical-explanation">Theoretical Explanation</h2>
<p><img src="/images/Pasted%20image%2020250121015614.png" alt="Image Description"></p>
<p>The voltage across a charging capacitor is given by the equation:</p>
<p>$$ V(t) = V_{\text{max}} \left( 1 - e^{-\frac{t}{RC}} \right) $$</p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vmax is the maximum voltage the capacitor can charge to (12 V in this case).</li>
<li>t is the time elapsed.</li>
<li>RC is the time constant of the circuit.</li>
</ul>
<p>As time passes, $$e^{-t/RC}$$ gets closer to zero.</p>
<p><img src="/images/Pasted%20image%2020250121015737.png" alt="Image Description">
This means it would take infinite time for the capacitor to reach exactly Vmax. In practice, we consider the capacitor &ldquo;fully charged&rdquo; when it’s close enough to Vmax, such as 99.3% at 5τ.</p>
<h2 id="the-simulation-discrepancy">The Simulation Discrepancy</h2>
<p><img src="/images/Pasted%20image%2020250121020039.png" alt="Image Description"></p>
<p>Interestingly, the simulation showed the capacitor reaching exactly 12 V, which seems to go against the theory. Why did this happen?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Oscilloscope Precision:</strong> Oscilloscopes show voltages with limited precision. If the capacitor voltage is extremely close to the maximum (e.g., 11.999999 V), the oscilloscope rounds it to 12 V.</li>
<li><strong>Rounding Effects:</strong> The actual voltage might still be slightly below 12 V, but the measuring device’s resolution hides these small differences. Higher-resolution equipment would show the tiny gap.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>At 5τ, a capacitor is 99.3% charged, not 100%.</li>
<li>It would take infinite time for a capacitor to reach exactly $Vmax$.</li>
<li>Simulations and measurements often show Vmax due to rounding and device limitations.</li>
<li>This approximation is fine for real-world use, as the difference is too small to matter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding these details gives a clearer picture of how capacitors behave and avoids common misunderstandings about what &ldquo;fully charged&rdquo; means.</p>
