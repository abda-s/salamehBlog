      <description><![CDATA[<p>The BYD Seagull is a compact electric vehicle equipped with lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, known for their durability and thermal stability. Understanding how different charging rates affect these batteries is crucial for optimizing both vehicle performance and battery longevity.</p>
<h2 id="byd-seagulls-charging-capabilities">BYD Seagull&rsquo;s Charging Capabilities</h2>
<p>The Seagull offers two battery options: a 30.08 kWh LFP battery and a 38.88 kWh LFP BYD Blade battery. Its charging infrastructure supports:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AC Charging</strong>: Up to 6.6 kW</li>
<li><strong>DC Fast Charging</strong>: 30 kW or 40 kW</li>
</ul>
<p>These specifications indicate that the Seagull is designed to handle various charging scenarios, from standard home charging to faster public charging stations.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-c-rates-and-their-impact">Understanding C-Rates and Their Impact</h2>
<p>The C-rate measures the rate at which a battery is charged or discharged relative to its capacity. A 1C rate means charging the entire battery in one hour. For the Seagull&rsquo;s 30.08 kWh battery:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1C Rate</strong>: 30.08 kW</li>
<li><strong>0.5C Rate</strong>: 15.04 kW</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="charging-with-an-8a-charger">Charging with an 8A Charger</h2>
<p>An 8-ampere (A) charger operating at 230 volts (V) delivers approximately 1.84 kW (8A × 230V). This translates to a C-rate of about 0.061 for the 30.08 kWh battery (1.84 kW ÷ 30.08 kWh). Such a low C-rate is considered gentle on the battery, minimizing stress and potentially extending its lifespan.</p>
<h2 id="charging-with-a-32a-charger">Charging with a 32A Charger</h2>
<p>A 32A charger at 230V provides around 7.36 kW (32A × 230V). For the 30.08 kWh battery, this results in a C-rate of approximately 0.245 (7.36 kW ÷ 30.08 kWh). This rate is still within the battery&rsquo;s designed AC charging capacity of 6.6 kW, indicating that the vehicle&rsquo;s onboard charger would limit the charging power to prevent potential overcharging.</p>
<h2 id="research-insights-on-lfp-batteries-and-charging-rates">Research Insights on LFP Batteries and Charging Rates</h2>
<p>Studies have shown that LFP batteries exhibit resilience to higher charging rates. For instance, research indicates that charging at rates up to 4C does not significantly impact the battery&rsquo;s lifespan. Specifically, capacity degradation was 15% at a 1C rate and 17% at a 4C rate after 4,000 cycles, with similar degradation observed up to 1,000 cycles.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Both 8A and 32A chargers operate within the BYD Seagull&rsquo;s charging specifications, suggesting minimal adverse effects on the LFP battery&rsquo;s health. The vehicle&rsquo;s battery management system is designed to regulate charging rates, ensuring optimal performance and longevity. However, consistently using higher charging rates can lead to increased heat generation, which may affect battery health over time. Therefore, balancing charging speeds based on daily driving needs and charging availability is advisable to maintain battery integrity.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="the-setup">The Setup</h2>
<p>My father brought an electrician home to wire an Ethernet cable from the router to my room. He ran the cable inside the wall, and everything seemed fine at first. However, when he crimped the RJ-45 connectors, he messed up, and the cable wasn’t working on my laptop. That meant I had to fix it myself.</p>
<p>To do this, I needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>An Ethernet cable tester</li>
<li>An Ethernet crimper</li>
<li>RJ-45 plugs</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s a photo of each item:</p>

<h2 id="understanding-the-ethernet-cable-tester">Understanding the Ethernet Cable Tester</h2>
<p>Before jumping in, I had to figure out how the Ethernet cable tester actually works. I watched a few YouTube videos and learned that it’s just a connectivity tester. An Ethernet cable has eight wires, and the tester checks each one sequentially. If the wire is properly connected, its corresponding LED blinks. If an LED doesn’t blink, that wire isn’t connected properly, meaning the cable is faulty.</p>
<p>To get comfortable with the tester, I tried it on an already working cable.</p>
<p><img src="/images/IMG-20250228-WA0021.jpg" alt="Image Description"></p>
<p>The LED numbers correspond to the pin numbers in the RJ-45 plug. Here’s an image showing the correct pin numbering:</p>
<p><img src="/images/wmremove-transformed.png" alt="Image Description"></p>
<h2 id="diagnosing-the-issue">Diagnosing the Issue</h2>
<p>Now that I understood how the tester works, I tested the cable the electrician installed. I connected the first part of the tester in the living room and the second part in my bedroom.</p>
<p><img src="/images/Pasted%20image%2020250228061200.png" alt="Image Description"></p>
<p>Here’s a video showing that all LEDs turned on except for number 7. That’s why the cable wasn’t working.</p>
<p><img src="/images/Timeline%201%201.gif" alt="Image Description"></p>
<h2 id="fixing-the-ethernet-cable">Fixing the Ethernet Cable</h2>
<p>To fix the issue, I had to replace the RJ-45 connectors on both ends of the cable. Initially, I only replaced the end in the living room and tested it again. If that fixed the issue, I wouldn’t need to replace the bedroom end. But in the end, I had to change both.</p>
<p>Here’s the YouTube video that helped me with the process: <a href="https://youtu.be/T1Cp9F8qto8?si=mocguZS7ddZXiqb7">Watch it here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="step-5-cutting-and-crimping-the-wires">Step 5: Cutting and Crimping the Wires</h4>
<p>After cutting the wires to the correct length, I used the crimper to attach the new RJ-45 plug.</p>

<h2 id="testing-the-fixed-cable">Testing the Fixed Cable</h2>
<p>I tested the cable again using the tester.</p>
<p>Now, it was time for the moment of truth. I tested the cable one more time using the Ethernet tester, and…</p>
<p><img src="/images/Timeline%202.gif" alt="Image Description"></p>
<p>Success! The tester confirmed that all the LEDs were lighting up correctly.</p>
<p>To be completely sure, I connected one end to the router and the other to my laptop. It worked!</p>

      <title>Understanding UART and Serial Communication</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="data-transmission">Data Transmission</h1>
<p>Data transmission can be categorized into two main types: <strong>Serial</strong> and <strong>Parallel</strong>. Serial communication, in particular, has several subtypes, including <strong>Asynchronous</strong>, <strong>Synchronous</strong>, and <strong>Isochronous</strong>. In this post, we’ll focus on <strong>UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)</strong>, which is an asynchronous method of communication. Unlike synchronous communication, UART does not require devices to share the same clock cycles or be synchronized.</p>
<p><img src="/images/Data%20transmission.png" alt="Image Description"></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="serial-vs-parallel-transmission">Serial vs. Parallel Transmission</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Serial Transmission</strong>: Data is sent one bit at a time over a single communication channel. This method is simpler and more cost-effective but can be slower compared to parallel transmission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Parallel Transmission</strong>: Data is sent in groups of 8 bits (a byte) simultaneously over multiple channels. While faster, it is more complex and expensive due to the need for multiple communication lines.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both methods enable devices to communicate, but they differ in their approach. Serial transmission is often preferred for its simplicity and lower cost, while parallel transmission is used when speed is critical.</p>
<p><img src="/images/parallel%20vs%20serail.png" alt="Image Description"></p>
<h3 id="key-terms">Key Terms:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>MSB (Most Significant Bit)</strong>: The bit with the highest value in a byte (e.g., 2^7).</li>
<li><strong>LSB (Least Significant Bit)</strong>: The bit with the lowest value in a byte (e.g., 2^0).</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="serial-transmission">Serial Transmission</h2>
<p>In serial transmission, bits are sent one after another over a single communication channel. This reduces the cost of transmission compared to parallel methods, which require multiple channels. Serial transmission can be implemented in three ways: <strong>asynchronous</strong>, <strong>synchronous</strong>, and <strong>isochronous</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="asynchronous-transmission-uart">Asynchronous Transmission (UART)</h3>
<p>Asynchronous transmission does not rely on a shared clock signal between devices. Instead, it uses agreed-upon patterns to communicate data. Each byte of data is framed with a <strong>start bit</strong> and one or more <strong>stop bits</strong>, allowing the receiver to identify the beginning and end of each byte.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start Bit</strong>: A single bit (usually 0) that signals the start of a byte.</li>
<li><strong>Stop Bit(s)</strong>: One or more bits (usually 1s) that signal the end of a byte.</li>
</ul>
<p>Between bytes, there may be a gap or idle time, which helps the receiver prepare for the next byte. The receiver synchronizes with the incoming data stream at the start of each byte, ensuring accurate data interpretation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Asynchronous transmission is &ldquo;asynchronous at the byte level,&rdquo; but the bits within each byte are still synchronized.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/images/serial%20byte.png" alt="Image Description"></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="uart-universal-asynchronous-receiver-transmitter">UART: Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter</h2>
<p>UART is a hardware device that facilitates asynchronous serial communication. It uses two wires:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tx (Transmit)</strong>: Sends data from the transmitting device.</li>
<li><strong>Rx (Receive)</strong>: Receives data at the receiving device.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/Pasted%20image%2020250215052600.png" alt="Image Description"></p>
<p>The communication speed, known as the <strong>baud rate</strong>, must be agreed upon by both devices.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="baud-rate-how-it-works">Baud Rate: How It Works</h3>
<p>The <strong>baud rate</strong> is a critical parameter in serial communication, especially in UART. It defines the speed at which data is transmitted and received, measured in <strong>bits per second (bps)</strong>. Here’s how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: The baud rate represents the number of signal changes (symbols) per second. In UART, each symbol typically corresponds to one bit, so the baud rate is often equal to the bit rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Synchronization</strong>: Both the transmitter and receiver must be configured to use the same baud rate. If they are not synchronized, data will be misinterpreted, leading to communication errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Common Baud Rates</strong>: Some standard baud rates include 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, and 115200 bps. Lower baud rates are used for longer distances or noisy environments, while higher baud rates are used for faster communication over shorter distances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Calculation</strong>: The baud rate determines the duration of each bit. For example, at 9600 bps, each bit lasts approximately 104 microseconds (1 second / 9600 bits).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Error Tolerance</strong>: The receiver samples the incoming data at the midpoint of each bit. If the baud rates of the transmitter and receiver are slightly mismatched, the sampling point may drift, causing errors. Therefore, precise baud rate configuration is essential.</p>
</li>
</ol>

      <title>Understanding Capacitor Charging and the Concept of Full Charge</title>
      <link>/posts/understanding-capacitor-charging-and-the-concept-of-full-charge/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/posts/understanding-capacitor-charging-and-the-concept-of-full-charge/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>While taking a <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLww54WQ2wa5qVh1p8iPi7HspX7N9hbvbc&amp;si=9h1KH2NZG2lSLsaB">course with Walid Issa</a>, we explored the fascinating behavior of capacitors. During one of the experiments, an interesting observation about capacitor charging sparked my curiosity. My friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmad-awad-36b481301/">Ahmad Awad</a> and I decided to dive deeper into the topic, conducting research that ultimately led to this blog.</p>
<p>When analyzing capacitors, we often hear that a capacitor is &ldquo;fully charged&rdquo; when the elapsed time equals 5 times the time constant (“5τ”). However, upon closer look, this statement needs some clarification. Let&rsquo;s dive into the theory, practical observations, and what &ldquo;fully charged&rdquo; really means.</p>
<h2 id="observations-from-the-simulation">Observations from the Simulation</h2>
<p><img src="/images/Pasted%20image%2020250121022953.png" alt="Image Description">
<img src="/images/Pasted%20image%2020250121023020.png" alt="Image Description"></p>
<p>In a recent calculation, the capacitor was expected to be fully charged in 0.25 seconds. However, the voltage across the capacitor at this point was 11.923 V instead of the expected 12 V. The error was calculated as:</p>
<p>$$ \frac{12 - 11.923}{12} \times 100 = 0.6% $$</p>
<p>This raised the question: Why is there an error when the capacitor is supposed to be fully charged at 5τ?</p>
<h2 id="the-truth-about-5τ">The Truth About 5τ</h2>
<p>The value of 5τ does not mean the capacitor is 100% charged. Instead, it means the capacitor has reached about 99.3% of its maximum voltage. Using the data from the simulation, we can confirm this:</p>
<p>$$ \frac{11.923}{12} \times 100 = 99.33% $$</p>
<p>This matches the theoretical prediction. While the capacitor seems nearly charged at 5τ, it never fully reaches 100% because of the exponential nature of its charging curve.</p>
<h2 id="theoretical-explanation">Theoretical Explanation</h2>
<p><img src="/images/Pasted%20image%2020250121015614.png" alt="Image Description"></p>
<p>The voltage across a charging capacitor is given by the equation:</p>
<p>$$ V(t) = V_{\text{max}} \left( 1 - e^{-\frac{t}{RC}} \right) $$</p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vmax is the maximum voltage the capacitor can charge to (12 V in this case).</li>
<li>t is the time elapsed.</li>
<li>RC is the time constant of the circuit.</li>
</ul>
<p>As time passes, $$e^{-t/RC}$$ gets closer to zero.</p>
<p><img src="/images/Pasted%20image%2020250121015737.png" alt="Image Description">
This means it would take infinite time for the capacitor to reach exactly Vmax. In practice, we consider the capacitor &ldquo;fully charged&rdquo; when it’s close enough to Vmax, such as 99.3% at 5τ.</p>
<h2 id="the-simulation-discrepancy">The Simulation Discrepancy</h2>
<p><img src="/images/Pasted%20image%2020250121020039.png" alt="Image Description"></p>
<p>Interestingly, the simulation showed the capacitor reaching exactly 12 V, which seems to go against the theory. Why did this happen?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Oscilloscope Precision:</strong> Oscilloscopes show voltages with limited precision. If the capacitor voltage is extremely close to the maximum (e.g., 11.999999 V), the oscilloscope rounds it to 12 V.</li>
<li><strong>Rounding Effects:</strong> The actual voltage might still be slightly below 12 V, but the measuring device’s resolution hides these small differences. Higher-resolution equipment would show the tiny gap.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>At 5τ, a capacitor is 99.3% charged, not 100%.</li>
<li>It would take infinite time for a capacitor to reach exactly $Vmax$.</li>
<li>Simulations and measurements often show Vmax due to rounding and device limitations.</li>
<li>This approximation is fine for real-world use, as the difference is too small to matter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding these details gives a clearer picture of how capacitors behave and avoids common misunderstandings about what &ldquo;fully charged&rdquo; means.</p>
