This image illustrates the workflow of this blog.

![Image Description](/images/Starting%20a%20blog%20with%20Hugo.png)
## Setting Up 

Before starting, ensure that you have **Git**, **Go** and **Python** installed on your system.

## Create Folder for Posts

First, create a folder in your Obsidian vault named `posts`.

![Image Description](/images/Pasted%20image%2020241206164602.png)

## Install Hugo

Next, install Hugo and add it to your environment variables.
Link: [https://gohugo.io/installation/](https://gohugo.io/installation/)

```powershell
## Verify Hugo works
hugo version

## Create a new site 
hugo new site websitename
cd websitename
```

## Initialize Git Repository

After creating your Hugo site, initialize a Git repository:

```powershell
git init
```

## Download a Hugo Theme

Go to [Hugo Themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/) and download a theme of your choice. For this example, we’ll use the theme **Hugo Ficurinia** from [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gabmus/hugo-ficurinia).

Use the following command to add the Hugo theme to your site:

```powershell
git submodule add -f [the repo link of the theme] themes/[name of the theme]
```
 
 For me I did this:

```powershell
git submodule add -f https://gitlab.com/gabmus/hugo-ficurinia.git themes/hugo-ficurinia
```
## Example Theme Configuration

Most themes come with an example configuration, which is typically the best way to get started. For the **hugo-ficurinia** theme:

```toml
baseURL = "/"
theme = "hugo-ficurinia"
title = "Abdullah Salameh's Blog"
languageCode = "en"
defaultContentLanguage = "en"
# this will be included in the footer after the current year the site is last
# built, followed by the (c) symbol
# you can use markdown inside this field
paginate = 5  # number of articles per page in the index
summaryLength = 50  # number of words for article summaries
[params]
    author = "Abdullah Salameh"
    description = "A description for my website"  # this will be added as metadata
    posts = "posts"  # content directory where to find home page posts; default searches in "posts" and "post"
    showPostsLink = true  # show or hide the link to the simple post list
    extraContentDirs = []  # other content directories to render similarly to the home page
    showcaseDir = "showcase"  # create a content directory that shows a special showcase section in the home page
    # shows a specified single page as a home page, instead of the traditional articles list
    # requires setting `homeSinglePage`

```

you can use the previse configuration in your `hugo.toml` file:

![Image Description](/images/Pasted%20image%2020241206143800.png)
## Test the Hugo Site Locally

Run the Hugo server to test if everything is set up correctly:

```powershell
hugo server -t [themename]
```

It's working but there isn't any posts ![Image Description](/images/Pasted%20image%2020241206144110.png)
## Add Posts

If everything is working but you don’t see any posts, create a `posts` folder inside the `content` directory:

```powershell
cd content
mkdir posts
```

## Sync Obsidian Notes with Hugo Posts

To sync your Obsidian notes with the Hugo posts folder, use the `robocopy` command:

```powershell
robocopy [sourcepath] [destination] /mir
```

![Image Description](/images/Pasted%20image%2020241206144306.png)
## Add Metadata for New Posts

When starting a new post, make sure to add the following metadata at the top of your markdown file:

```
---
title: blogtitle
date: 2024-11-06
draft: false
tags:
  - tag1
  - tag2
---
```

![Image Description](/images/Pasted%20image%2020241206175820.png)
## Add Images to Hugo

When you add images to your Obsidian notes, they won’t appear in the Hugo site because the image source is only in Obsidian. To fix this, use the following Python script to copy the images to the Hugo static folder.

```python
import os
import re
import shutil

# Paths (using raw strings to handle Windows backslashes correctly)
posts_dir = r"C:\Users\3adas\Documents\salamehBlog\content\posts"
attachments_dir = r"C:\Users\3adas\OneDrive\Notes\files"
static_images_dir = r"C:\Users\3adas\Documents\salamehBlog\static\images"

# Step 1: Process each markdown file in the posts directory
for filename in os.listdir(posts_dir):
    if filename.endswith(".md"):
        filepath = os.path.join(posts_dir, filename)
        
        with open(filepath, "r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
            content = file.read()
        
        # Step 2: Find all image links in the format ![[image.extension]]
        images = re.findall(r'\[\[([^]]+\.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif|bmp|webp|svg))\]\]', content, re.IGNORECASE)
        
        # Step 3: Replace image links and ensure URLs are correctly formatted
        for image, _ in images:  # `_` is unused, it contains the extension from the regex group
            # Prepare the Markdown-compatible link with %20 replacing spaces
            markdown_image = f"![Image Description](/images/{image.replace(' ', '%20')})"
            content = content.replace(f"![[{image}]]", markdown_image)
            
            # Step 4: Copy the image to the Hugo static/images directory if it exists
            image_source = os.path.join(attachments_dir, image)
            if os.path.exists(image_source):
                shutil.copy(image_source, static_images_dir)

        # Step 5: Write the updated content back to the markdown file
        with open(filepath, "w", encoding="utf-8") as file:
            file.write(content)

print("Markdown files processed and images copied successfully.")

```

### Run the Python Script

Save the above Python script as `images.py` in the root folder of your Hugo site. Run the script using:

```powershell
python images.py
```


## Upload the Code to GitHub

To upload your Hugo site to GitHub, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create a New Repository

1. Click the **plus icon** in GitHub.  
    ![Image Description](/images/Pasted%20image%2020241206145729.png)
    
2. Select **New repository** from the dropdown menu.  
    ![Image Description](/images/Pasted%20image%2020241206145803.png)
    
3. Name your repository. For example, you could use `salamehBlog`, Set the repository to **Public**.
    ![Image Description](/images/Pasted%20image%2020241206150019.png)
    
4. Click **Create repository**.  
    ![Image Description](/images/Pasted%20image%2020241206150113.png)
    

---

### Step 2: Push Your Code to GitHub

1. Add the remote origin for your repository:
```powershell
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/salamehBlog.git
```
	
2. Build the website:
```powershell
hugo
```
	
3. Add all files to the staging area:
```powershell
git add .
```
    
4. Commit your changes:
```powershell
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
    
5. Push the code to GitHub:
```powershell
git push -u origin main
```
	
6. Create a new branch for GitHub pages to deploy from 
```powershell
git subtree split --prefix public -b gh-pages-deploy
git push origin gh-pages-deploy:gh-pages --force
git branch -D gh-pages-deploy
```

After completing these steps, your Hugo website will be successfully uploaded to GitHub and ready for deployment.

## Deployment

1. Navigate to the **Settings** of your GitHub repository.
    
2. Select **Pages** from the left-hand menu.
    
3. Choose the `gh-pages` branch and set your custom domain.  
    ![Image Description](/images/Pasted%20image%2020241206182531.png)
    
4. In the `public` folder of your Hugo project, create a file named `CNAME`.
	![Image Description](/images/Pasted%20image%2020241206182922.png)
1. Add your custom domain (e.g., `blog.salameh.top`) inside the `CNAME` file.

##  Automation Script

Now that everything is set up, we need to address the challenge of running multiple commands each time we want to publish a post. This process is prone to human error and can be cumbersome. To streamline this, we’ll create a PowerShell script that automates the entire workflow.

1. **Create the Script**  
    In the root folder of your blog, create a new file named `updateblog.ps1` and paste the following code into it:

```powershell
# PowerShell Script for Windows

# Set variables for Obsidian to Hugo copy
$sourcePath = "C:\Users\3adas\OneDrive\Notes\posts"
$destinationPath = "C:\Users\3adas\Documents\salamehBlog\content\posts"

# Set Github repo 
$myrepo = "reponame"

# Set error handling
$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"
Set-StrictMode -Version Latest

# Change to the script's directory
$ScriptDir = Split-Path -Parent $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Definition
Set-Location $ScriptDir

# Check for required commands
$requiredCommands = @('git', 'hugo')

# Check for Python command (python or python3)
if (Get-Command 'python' -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue) {
    $pythonCommand = 'python'
} elseif (Get-Command 'python3' -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue) {
    $pythonCommand = 'python3'
} else {
    Write-Error "Python is not installed or not in PATH."
    exit 1
}

foreach ($cmd in $requiredCommands) {
    if (-not (Get-Command $cmd -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue)) {
        Write-Error "$cmd is not installed or not in PATH."
        exit 1
    }
}

# Step 1: Check if Git is initialized, and initialize if necessary
if (-not (Test-Path ".git")) {
    Write-Host "Initializing Git repository..."
    git init
    git remote add origin $myrepo
} else {
    Write-Host "Git repository already initialized."
    $remotes = git remote
    if (-not ($remotes -contains 'origin')) {
        Write-Host "Adding remote origin..."
        git remote add origin $myrepo
    }
}

# Step 2: Sync posts from Obsidian to Hugo content folder using Robocopy
Write-Host "Syncing posts from Obsidian..."

if (-not (Test-Path $sourcePath)) {
    Write-Error "Source path does not exist: $sourcePath"
    exit 1
}

if (-not (Test-Path $destinationPath)) {
    Write-Error "Destination path does not exist: $destinationPath"
    exit 1
}

# Use Robocopy to mirror the directories
$robocopyOptions = @('/MIR', '/Z', '/W:5', '/R:3')
$robocopyResult = robocopy $sourcePath $destinationPath @robocopyOptions

if ($LASTEXITCODE -ge 8) {
    Write-Error "Robocopy failed with exit code $LASTEXITCODE"
    exit 1
}

# Step 3: Process Markdown files with Python script to handle image links
Write-Host "Processing image links in Markdown files..."
if (-not (Test-Path "images.py")) {
    Write-Error "Python script images.py not found."
    exit 1
}

# Execute the Python script
try {
    & $pythonCommand images.py
} catch {
    Write-Error "Failed to process image links."
    exit 1
}

# Step 4: Build the Hugo site
Write-Host "Building the Hugo site..."
try {
    hugo
} catch {
    Write-Error "Hugo build failed."
    exit 1
}

# Step 5: Add changes to Git, including handling deletions
Write-Host "Staging changes for Git..."

# Detect changes and include deletions
$gitStatus = git status --porcelain

if (-not $gitStatus) {
    Write-Host "No changes to stage."
} else {
    # Stage all changes, including deletions
    Write-Host "Staging all changes, including deletions..."
    git add --all
}


# Step 6: Commit changes with a dynamic message
$commitMessage = "synced posts on $(Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss')"
$hasStagedChanges = (git diff --cached --name-only) -ne ""
if (-not $hasStagedChanges) {
    Write-Host "No changes to commit."
} else {
    Write-Host "Committing changes..."
    git commit -m "$commitMessage"
}

# Step 7: Push all changes to the main branch
Write-Host "Deploying to GitHub Master..."
try {
    git push origin master
} catch {
    Write-Error "Failed to push to Master branch."
    exit 1
}

# Step 8: Push the public folder to the gh-pages branch using subtree split and force push
Write-Host "Deploying to GitHub pages..."

# Check if the temporary branch exists and delete it
$branchExists = git branch --list "gh-pages-deploy"
if ($branchExists) {
    git branch -D gh-pages-deploy
}

# Perform subtree split
try {
    git subtree split --prefix public -b gh-pages-deploy
} catch {
    Write-Error "Subtree split failed."
    exit 1
}

# Push to gh-pages branch with force
try {
    git push origin gh-pages-deploy:gh-pages --force
} catch {
    Write-Error "Failed to push to hostinger branch."
    git branch -D gh-pages-deploy
    exit 1
}

# Delete the temporary branch
git branch -D gh-pages-deploy

Write-Host "All done! Site synced, processed, committed, built, and deployed."

```

2. **Run the Script**  
    Each time you want to sync or upload a new post, simply execute the script:
```powershell
.\updateblog.ps1
```
