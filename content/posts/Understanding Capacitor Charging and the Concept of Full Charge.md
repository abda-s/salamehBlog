While taking a [course with Waleed Essa](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLww54WQ2wa5qVh1p8iPi7HspX7N9hbvbc&si=9h1KH2NZG2lSLsaB), we explored the fascinating behavior of capacitors. During one of the experiments, an interesting observation about capacitor charging sparked my curiosity. My friend [Ahmad Awad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmad-awad-36b481301/) and I decided to dive deeper into the topic, conducting research that ultimately led to this blog.

When analyzing capacitors, we often hear that a capacitor is "fully charged" when the elapsed time equals 5 times the time constant (“5τ”). However, upon closer look, this statement needs some clarification. Let's dive into the theory, practical observations, and what "fully charged" really means.

## Observations from the Simulation

In a recent calculation, the capacitor was expected to be fully charged in 0.25 seconds. However, the voltage across the capacitor at this point was 11.923 V instead of the expected 12 V. The error was calculated as:

${(12-11.923)/12}*100 = 0.6$% 

This raised the question: Why is there an error when the capacitor is supposed to be fully charged at 5τ?

## The Truth About 5τ

The value of 5τ does not mean the capacitor is 100% charged. Instead, it means the capacitor has reached about 99.3% of its maximum voltage. Using the data from the simulation, we can confirm this:

$11.923/12 * 100 = 99.33$%

This matches the theoretical prediction. While the capacitor seems nearly charged at 5τ, it never fully reaches 100% because of the exponential nature of its charging curve.

## Theoretical Explanation

The voltage across a charging capacitor is given by the equation:

$V(t) = V_{max}(1-e^{-t/RC})$

where:

- $V_{max}$ is the maximum voltage the capacitor can charge to (12 V in this case).
- $t$ is the time elapsed.
- $RC$ is the time constant of the circuit.

As time passes, $e^{-t/RC}$ gets closer to zero.

This means it would take infinite time for the capacitor to reach exactly $V_{\text{max}}$. In practice, we consider the capacitor "fully charged" when it’s close enough to $V_{\text{max}}$, such as 99.3% at 5τ.

## The Simulation Discrepancy

Interestingly, the simulation showed the capacitor reaching exactly 12 V, which seems to go against the theory. Why did this happen?

1. **Oscilloscope Precision:** Oscilloscopes show voltages with limited precision. If the capacitor voltage is extremely close to the maximum (e.g., 11.999999 V), the oscilloscope rounds it to 12 V.
2. **Rounding Effects:** The actual voltage might still be slightly below 12 V, but the measuring device’s resolution hides these small differences. Higher-resolution equipment would show the tiny gap.

## Key Takeaways

- At 5τ, a capacitor is 99.3% charged, not 100%.
- It would take infinite time for a capacitor to reach exactly $V_{\text{max}}$.
- Simulations and measurements often show $V_{\text{max}}$ due to rounding and device limitations.
- This approximation is fine for real-world use, as the difference is too small to matter.

Understanding these details gives a clearer picture of how capacitors behave and avoids common misunderstandings about what "fully charged" means.
