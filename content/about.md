Hello, and welcome to my blog! I'm an aspiring **Electrical Engineer** with a passion for combining creativity, innovation, and technology to solve real-world problems. I recently completed an internship as a **Full Stack Developer** at **Inspire for Development Solutions**, where I honed my skills in modern web development. Currently, I’m an intern at **HTU Hacker Space**, focusing on cutting-edge electrical engineering challenges.

## A Little About My Journey

With a foundation in **Electrical Engineering**, I’ve explored various disciplines, including **full-stack development**, **robotics**, and **app development**. During my time at Inspire, I worked extensively with **React**, **Redux**, **Node.js**, and **MongoDB**, developing impactful solutions. Now, I’m diving deeper into the world of electronics and embedded systems at HTU Hacker Space.

Some highlights from my journey include:

- Developing a **Job Portal Web Application** with features like CV building, job posting, and application tracking.
- Designing and building an **Arduino-based environmental monitoring system** with temperature, humidity, and soil sensors.
- **CaReminder - Smart Pill Dispenser:** A smart device integrated with a mobile app to streamline medication management, featuring precision dispensing, real-time notifications, and SolidWorks-designed components.  


## My Tech Toolbox

Here’s a glimpse of the tools and technologies I work with:

- **Frontend:** React, Redux, Material-UI (MUI), Expo  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB  
- **Hardware:** Arduino, ESP32, DHT11 sensors, LCD modules, custom control circuits  
- **Design and Simulation:** SolidWorks, PCB Design  


## Beyond Work

Outside of engineering, I love drawing, watching movies and TV shows—two of my favorite series are *Breaking Bad* and *Arcane*. In my downtime, I enjoy playing video games, with *Cyberpunk 2077* and *Red Dead Redemption 2* being among the best games I’ve ever played. I’m always excited to learn, collaborate, and build innovative solutions that make a difference.
