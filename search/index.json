Vim’s modes are its core strength, allowing efficient text manipulation and navigation. Each mode has a specific purpose, and transitioning between them is seamless.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":[],"text":"everything is based on this video.\ninstalling vim first, check if it’s installed by typing vi or vim in the terminal. if you see the following output: ! it means the program is installed. otherwise, you’ll need to install it using your linux package manager.\nif you\u0026rsquo;re on ubuntu, use the following commands:\nsudo apt install vi or\nsudo apt install vim understanding vim modes vim has several modes, each designed for specific tasks. vim’s modes are its core strength, allowing efficient text manipulation and navigation. each mode has a specific purpose, and transitioning between them is seamless.\n1. normal mode purpose: the default mode for navigating and executing commands.\nhow to enter: press esc from any mode.\nfeatures in normal mode: cursor navigation: use h (left), j (down), k (up), and l (right). jump words with w (next word) or b (back a word). jump to start/end of the line with ^/$. editing commands: dd: delete a line. yy: copy (yank) a line. p: paste copied/cut text. u: undo the last change. search \u0026amp; replace: /the-thing-you-want: search forward for \u0026ldquo;the-thing-you-want\u0026rdquo;. ?the-thing-you-want: search backward for \u0026ldquo;the-thing-you-want\u0026rdquo;. exiting normal mode: you\u0026rsquo;re always in normal mode unless you\u0026rsquo;ve entered another mode. press esc to ensure you\u0026rsquo;re back.\n2. insert mode purpose: to insert text into the file.\nin vim, capitalized versions of commands often extend or modify the behavior of their lowercase counterparts, typically operating on a larger scope or providing a slightly different action. here’s how capitalized versions of i, a, and o behave and differ from their lowercase equivalents:\ni vs. i i (insert mode): enters insert mode at the current cursor position. you can begin inserting text immediately before the character where the cursor is located. i (insert at start of line): enters insert mode at the beginning of the current line, skipping over any leading whitespace or indentation. this is useful for quickly editing or appending text at the start of a line without manually navigating there. example: this is a sentence. (cursor on the \u0026#34;t\u0026#34;) pressing `i`: insert before \u0026#34;t\u0026#34;. pressing `i`: insert at the very start of the line (before the \u0026#34;t\u0026#34; and leading spaces). a vs. a a (append mode): enters insert mode immediately after the current cursor position. allows you to append text to the current character. a (append at end of line): enters insert mode at the end of the current line, regardless of the cursor’s current position. ideal for quickly adding text at the end of a line. example: this is a sentence. (cursor on \u0026#34;t\u0026#34;) pressing `a`: append after \u0026#34;t\u0026#34;. pressing `a`: jump to the end of the line and begin inserting. o vs. o o (open below): opens a new line below the current line and enters insert mode. convenient for adding new lines after the current one. o (open above): opens a new line above the current line and enters insert mode. useful for quickly inserting new lines before the current line. example: line 1 line 2 (cursor here) line 3 pressing `o`: opens a new line below \u0026#34;line 2\u0026#34;. pressing `o`: opens a new line above \u0026#34;line 2\u0026#34;. why capitalization matters capitalized commands like i, a, and o are shortcuts for actions that would otherwise require additional steps or motions:\ni saves time by avoiding manual navigation to the start of the line. a avoids navigating to the end of the line before appending. **o and o make it easy to insert blank lines without leaving the current context. this behavior reflects vim\u0026rsquo;s philosophy of providing shortcuts for repetitive or common editing tasks while maintaining efficient text editing workflows. by mastering these commands, you can significantly improve your productivity in vim.\nfeatures in insert mode: type as you would in a regular text editor. use arrow keys to navigate (though it\u0026rsquo;s better to return to normal mode for navigation). exiting insert mode: press esc to return to normal mode.\n3. visual mode purpose: to select text for manipulation.\nhow to enter:\nv: character-wise selection. v: line-wise selection. ctrl+v: block/column-wise selection. features in visual mode: highlight text with cursor movement. perform actions like: d: cut (delete) selection. y: copy (yank) selection. \u0026gt;/\u0026lt;: indent or unindent selection. it\u0026rsquo;s like pressing tab u/u: convert selection to uppercase/lowercase. exiting visual mode: press esc to return to normal mode.\n4. command-line mode purpose: execute advanced commands like saving, quitting, or search-and-replace.\nhow to enter:\n:: for general commands. /: for forward search. ?: for backward search. examples of commands: :w: save changes. :q: quit. :wq: save and quit. :q!: quit without saving. :s/old/new/g: replace \u0026ldquo;old\u0026rdquo; with \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; in the current line. exiting command-line mode: press esc to cancel the current command or after executing it.\nthese modes make vim incredibly versatile, catering to diverse editing needs and workflows. by mastering them, you unlock vim\u0026rsquo;s full potential for efficient text editing.\ncombining multiple commands in vim, you can combine multiple commands to perform actions in sequence on text or the file you\u0026rsquo;re editing. this allows for powerful, efficient editing without needing to switch modes repeatedly.\ncommands cheat sheet !\nusing command combinations you can combine commands by using command prefixes, which allow you to perform multiple actions in a single command.\nexamples of command combinations: delete word (diw):\nthe command diw combines two commands:\nd: delete iw: inner word (selects the word under the cursor). this deletes the word under the cursor without deleting the space after it.\nthe quick brown fox if the cursor is on \u0026ldquo;quick\u0026rdquo;, pressing diw will delete \u0026ldquo;quick\u0026rdquo;, leaving \u0026ldquo;the brown fox\u0026rdquo;.\nchange word (ciw):\nciw stands for \u0026ldquo;change inner word\u0026rdquo;.\nc: change (deletes and enters insert mode) iw: inner word (selects the word under the cursor). this command deletes the word and enters insert mode for you to type a new word.\nthe quick brown fox if the cursor is on \u0026ldquo;quick\u0026rdquo;, pressing ciw will delete \u0026ldquo;quick\u0026rdquo; and place the cursor in insert mode to type a new word.\ndelete inside brackets (di():\ndi( combines d (delete) and i( (inner parentheses).\nit deletes the contents inside parentheses, but leaves the parentheses themselves intact.\nthis is (sample text) inside parentheses. if the cursor is inside the parentheses, pressing di( will delete \u0026ldquo;sample text\u0026rdquo; but leave the parentheses.\nyank line (yy):\nyy yanks (copies) the entire line the cursor is on, including line breaks. you can also use 2yy to yank multiple lines at once (in this case, 2 lines). indent selection (\u0026gt; or \u0026lt;):\nto indent a selection, you can use the \u0026gt; command. in visual mode (v or v), you can select a block of text and then use \u0026gt; to indent the entire block. to un-indent, use \u0026lt;. undo and redo:\nu: undo the last change. ctrl+r: redo the undone change. combining commands with count prefixes: you can also prefix commands with numbers to apply them a certain number of times.\nexample: 5dd: deletes 5 lines starting from the cursor\u0026rsquo;s current position. example: 3w: moves the cursor forward 3 words. this technique of combining commands and using prefixes significantly enhances vim\u0026rsquo;s efficiency, making it easier to manipulate text with fewer keystrokes.\nthe :set command here are examples of the :set command in vim, showcasing how to customize the editor\u0026rsquo;s behavior and appearance:\n1. enable line numbers absolute line numbers:\n:set number displays line numbers on the left-hand side of the screen.\nrelative line numbers:\n:set relativenumber shows line numbers relative to the current cursor position, making it easier to navigate using commands like 5j or 10k.\ndisable line numbers:\n:set nonumber :set norelativenumber disables both absolute and relative line numbers.\n2. highlight search results enable search highlighting:\n:set hlsearch highlights all search matches in the document.\ndisable search highlighting:\n:set nohlsearch turns off the search highlighting after completing a search.\nenable incremental search:\n:set incsearch shows search results as you type, instead of waiting until you press enter.\ndisable incremental search:\n:set noincsearch 3. auto-indentation enable auto-indentation:\n:set smartindent automatically indents new lines based on the previous line\u0026rsquo;s indentation (useful for programming).\nenable syntax-based indentation:\n:set filetype=python :set smarttab :set autoindent :set tabstop=4 :set shiftwidth=4 customizes indentation rules for a specific file type, such as python. these settings ensure consistent indentation using 4 spaces.\ndisable auto-indentation:\n:set noautoindent :set nosmartindent 4. tab and space settings set tab width:\n:set tabstop=4 sets the width of a tab character to 4 spaces.\nset indentation width:\n:set shiftwidth=4 sets the number of spaces to use for indentation when pressing \u0026gt; or \u0026lt;.\nuse spaces instead of tabs:\n:set expandtab converts tab characters to spaces (commonly used in python and other languages).\nuse tabs instead of spaces:\n:set noexpandtab ensures that tabs are inserted when the tab key is pressed, rather than spaces.\n5. line wrapping enable line wrapping:\n:set wrap enables text wrapping, so lines that extend past the screen width are wrapped onto the next line.\ndisable line wrapping:\n:set nowrap disables text wrapping, and long lines will scroll horizontally instead of wrapping.\n6. search case sensitivity case-insensitive search:\n:set ignorecase makes searches case-insensitive (e.g., searching for \u0026ldquo;apple\u0026rdquo; will match \u0026ldquo;apple\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;apple\u0026rdquo;, etc.).\ncase-sensitive search:\n:set noignorecase ensures searches are case-sensitive.\nsmart case search:\n:set smartcase makes searches case-insensitive unless you use an uppercase letter in the search query. for example, searching for \u0026ldquo;apple\u0026rdquo; will match all cases, but searching for \u0026ldquo;apple\u0026rdquo; will only match \u0026ldquo;apple\u0026rdquo;.\n7. auto-completion enable file completion:\n:set wildmenu enhances the command-line completion feature with a graphical menu-like interface.\nenable path completion:\n:set wildmode=list:longest enables more intuitive file path completion on the command line.\n8. backup and swap files disable swap files:\n:set noswapfile disables the creation of swap files. swap files are used for recovering unsaved changes in case of a crash.\nenable backup files:\n:set backup :set backupdir=~/vim-backups enables creating backup files when saving a file and specifies the directory for backups.\ndisable backup files:\n:set nobackup 9. status line customization enable the status line:\n:set laststatus=2 always shows the status line at the bottom of the vim window.\ndisable the status line:\n:set laststatus=0 10. show line and column number enable line and column number display: :set ruler displays the current line and column number in the status line, so you always know your position in the file. 11. mouse support enable mouse support:\n:set mouse=a enables mouse support for selecting text and resizing windows inside vim.\ndisable mouse support:\n:set mouse= 12. vim colorscheme set a colorscheme: :colorscheme desert sets the colorscheme to \u0026ldquo;desert\u0026rdquo; (you can replace desert with any other installed colorscheme like elflord, morning, or industry). 13. line break characters display non-printing characters:\n:set list :set listchars=tab:»·,trail:· this shows special characters like tabs (») and trailing spaces (·), which can be useful for cleaning up your text.\nhide non-printing characters:\n:set nolist these :set commands let you tweak vim to match your workflow and preferences, from simple appearance changes to more advanced features like auto-indentation or search behaviors. once you’ve customized your settings, you can even save them in your .vimrc file to make these changes permanent across sessions.\n.vimrc file the .vimrc file is a configuration file that vim loads at startup, allowing you to customize vim’s behavior. location of the .vimrc file: ~/.vimrc\nbasic structure the .vimrc file contains vim commands for settings, keybindings, and other customizations.\n\u0026#34; enable line numbers set number \u0026#34; enable syntax highlighting syntax enable \u0026#34; set color scheme to \u0026#39;desert\u0026#39; colorscheme desert \u0026#34; enable smart indentation, set tab width and spaces for indentation set smartindent \u0026#34;

\u0026#34; ignore case during search and highlight search results set ignorecase \u0026#34; ignore case in searches set hlsearch \u0026#34; highlight search matches \u0026#34; enable mouse support in all modes set mouse=a \u0026#34; mouse can be used in all modes (normal, insert, visual, etc.) \u0026#34; enable backup files and specify backup directory set backup \u0026#34; enable backup files set backupdir=~/vim-backups \u0026#34; set the directory for backup files \u0026#34; automatically set the filetype to python for .py files autocmd bufread,bufnewfile *.py set filetype=python \u0026#34; map \u0026#39;jj\u0026#39; to escape insert mode (useful for avoiding the esc key) inoremap jj \u0026lt;esc\u0026gt; \u0026#34; press \u0026#39;jj\u0026#39; to exit insert mode explanation of comments: line numbers: displays line numbers for easier navigation. syntax highlighting: enables syntax color coding for better readability. color scheme: sets a predefined color scheme for the editor. indentation: configures tab and space behavior to match the desired coding style. search settings: makes searches case-insensitive and highlights matching results. mouse support: allows using the mouse in all vim modes. backup files: enables backups and sets the directory where backup files will be stored. filetype settings: automatically applies file-specific settings based on file extension (e.g., python for .py files). key mapping: allows custom key mappings, such as pressing jj to exit insert mode. waypoints in vim waypoints are useful for marking specific places in your file to quickly return to. this can be especially helpful when navigating through large files. in vim, waypoints are often referred to as marks.\nsetting and using marks: set a mark: to set a mark, press m followed by a letter (a-z). for example, ma sets a mark named a at the current cursor position. jump to a mark: to jump to a specific mark, press ' followed by the mark\u0026rsquo;s letter. for example, 'a takes you to the position where mark a was set. view all marks: you can see a list of all active marks by typing :marks. example: move to a specific line, say line 10. set a mark with ma (mark \u0026ldquo;a\u0026rdquo;). continue editing elsewhere. return to the mark by typing 'a. marks allow you to quickly navigate between important points in your file without needing to rely on line numbers or searching.\nthe :reg command the :reg command in vim allows you to view and manage the contents of vim\u0026rsquo;s registers. registers are temporary storage areas where text is stored when you cut, copy, or paste in vim. this command helps you access these stored texts, allowing for easy retrieval and reuse.\nviewing registers to view the contents of all registers, type :reg and press enter. this will display a list of registers and their contents. using specific registers you can access specific registers by typing :reg followed by the register name. for example, :reg a shows the contents of register a. types of registers: unnamed register (\u0026quot;\u0026quot;): stores text that was last yanked or deleted. named registers (a-z): these are registers that you can explicitly specify when yanking or deleting. you can yank or delete to a specific register with \u0026quot;a, \u0026quot;b, etc. numbered registers (0-9): automatically store text from the most recent yank or delete operations, with 0 holding the most recent yank. special registers: \u0026quot;%: the current file name. \u0026quot;#: the name of the alternate file. \u0026quot;* and \u0026quot;+: access to the system clipboard (if supported). macro registers (q-z): these registers are used to store macros (sequences of commands). by recording a macro, you can save a sequence of commands to a register and replay them later. examples: copying to a register: \u0026quot;ayw: yank a word into register a. pasting from a register: \u0026quot;ap: paste the content of register a. viewing register contents: :reg a: view the contents of register a. saving a macro to a register: press q followed by any register letter (e.g., qa) to start recording a macro into register a perform the desired actions. press q again to stop recording. playing a macro from a register: press @a to replay the macro stored in register a. the :reg command, along with macro functionality, gives you powerful tools to manage and reuse text and commands in vim, enhancing your productivity and workflow.\n","title":"Learning
